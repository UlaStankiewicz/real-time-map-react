## High Performance React App

![React Map Screenshot](/public/reactMap.png?raw=true)


The application is a simple web page that displays a map and several markers (cars) on the map and updates it in real time, built with 
* React.js, 
* Node.js, 
* React-Leaflet,
* Socket.io, 
* styled-components. 
This is simulation of tracking meachanism for several items that move. In addition, the application allows you to search for displayed objects.
